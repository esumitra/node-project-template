# Service Rules

These rules govern backend services, especially Fastify modules, Prisma-backed services, DTOs, mappers, and OpenAPI generation.

---

## 1. Core Standards

- Use TypeScript strict mode.
- Use English for code and documentation.
- Avoid `any`.
- Prefer explicit return types on exported functions and public methods.
- Use descriptive names and small, focused functions.
- Prefer immutable data and `readonly` where practical.
- Use shared enums/constants instead of bare string literals.

### Banned Backend Patterns

- Returning hardcoded sample JSON from handlers
- Returning raw Prisma entities directly from handlers
- Defining a route without a real `schema.response`
- Shipping mock data or development-only fallbacks in application code
- Hand-editing generated OpenAPI/client output
- Fixing generated-client problems with frontend casts instead of repairing backend schemas

---

## 2. No Mock Data in Application Code

- Never include mock data, fake data, stub responses, or hardcoded sample records in backend application code.
- Handlers must return real service results backed by real repositories/data access.
- If a dependency is missing, implement it or surface a real error. Do not fake the response.

---

## 3. Fastify Module Structure

Organize backend code by domain module.

Typical module layout:

```
modules/<domain>/
  routes.ts      # Fastify schemas, handler wiring
  handler.ts     # HTTP → service translation
  service.ts     # Business logic
```

Rules:

- Keep one domain area per module.
- Route files define Fastify schemas and wire handlers.
- Handlers translate HTTP concerns to service calls.
- Services own business logic.
- Mappers translate domain/service results to DTOs.

---

## 4. DTOs, Mappers, and OpenAPI

The project uses DTO-driven API contracts.

### Required Backend Flow

For every API endpoint:

1. Define or update the DTO Zod schema in the shared `dto/` package.
2. Map domain/service results to that DTO in the `mappers/` directory.
3. Use `zodToJsonSchema()` in the Fastify route schema for request/response payloads.
4. Provide `tags`, `summary`, and unique `operationId`.
5. Regenerate and validate the shared OpenAPI/client artifacts.

### Mapper File Requirement

Every module that registers Fastify routes **must** have a corresponding mapper file. The mapper file must export named functions (e.g., `mapContestToDto`, `mapLeagueToListItem`) that handlers call to transform service/domain results into DTO shapes.

- Inline `.map()` transformations in route handlers or handler files are not acceptable.
- The mapper is the single place where persistence/domain shapes are translated to API response shapes.
- Modules exempt from this rule: `config` (static data only), `health` (no domain objects).

### Required Route Schema Fields

Every route must include:

- `tags`
- `summary`
- `operationId`
- Request schema where applicable (`body`, `params`, `querystring`)
- `response` schema for every supported status returned by the handler

### Response Rules

- Always describe the real response envelope.
- If the response is `{ league: ... }`, schema must say `{ league: ... }`.
- Dates over the wire must be ISO 8601 strings, not `Date` objects.

### Generated Artifacts Rules

- Run `npm run api:refresh` after DTO/route changes that affect the contract.
- Run `npm run api:validate` after regeneration.
- Never hand-edit generated OpenAPI or client files.

### What Not To Do

- Do not leave placeholder response schemas on endpoints that return real domain data.
- Do not omit response schemas because "the frontend already knows."
- Do not add local frontend interfaces to paper over backend schema gaps.

---

## 5. Prisma and Persistence

- Use Prisma for database access.
- Keep persistence concerns out of handlers.
- Keep Prisma row shapes from leaking directly into API responses.
- When Prisma models change, update DTOs, mappers, route schemas, and tests in the same work.
- Prefer explicit mapping from persistence models to domain/DTO models.

---

## 6. Enums, Constants, and Paths

### Enums and Status Values

- Never compare important state with ad hoc bare strings if a shared enum/constant exists.
- Use shared domain constants/enums.
- Route schema enums must derive from shared values, not copied literal arrays.

### Route Constants

- A shared `api-routes.ts` is the canonical route constant registry.
- Use it for backend registration prefixes, integration tests, smoke tests, and MSW handlers.

### Frontend Boundary

- Frontend runtime app code should prefer the generated SDK over manual path constants.
- Backend work must still keep route constants current for non-generated consumers.

---

## 7. Error Handling

- Catch exceptions only to add context, translate domain errors, or handle expected failures.
- Do not swallow backend errors to preserve a fake success path.
- Prefer clear typed/domain errors over ambiguous generic errors.
- Let global Fastify error handling deal with unhandled failures.

### Error Response Shape Consistency

All error responses must follow a consistent envelope:

```typescript
{
  error: {
    code: string;         // machine-readable (e.g., "LEAGUE_NOT_FOUND", "VALIDATION_ERROR")
    message: string;      // human-readable description
    details?: unknown;    // optional structured details (validation field errors, etc.)
  }
}
```

Rules:
- Every 4xx and 5xx response must return this envelope.
- Validation errors (400) should include `details` with per-field errors when available.
- Not-found errors (404) should use domain-specific codes (e.g., `CONTEST_NOT_FOUND`).
- Permission errors (403) should use codes that distinguish the denial reason (e.g., `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSION`, `NOT_MEMBER`).
- Intentional application errors must use stable, descriptive, domain-specific codes rather than transport-only placeholders such as `BAD_REQUEST`, `FORBIDDEN`, or `NOT_FOUND` when the domain reason is known.
- Error codes must be specific enough for clients and tests to distinguish materially different failures that share the same HTTP status.
- Human-readable messages must explain the real failure clearly without exposing unsafe internals.
- When useful, `details` should carry structured machine-readable context rather than ad hoc string blobs.
- Define a shared Zod schema for the error envelope in the shared `dto/` package.
- Fastify's global error handler should format unhandled errors into this envelope where practical, and new route work should not bypass that standard.
- Route schemas must declare error response shapes for the most relevant statuses such as 400, 401, 403, and 404.

---

## 8. Testing Expectations for Backend Work

- Unit-test service logic.
- Integration-test request/response behavior with Fastify `inject`.
- Add SDK functional tests for use-case workflows, CRUD, auth, and error paths.
- When API schema changes, verify: functional tests, `api:refresh`, `api:validate`.

### Do Not Preserve Bad Tests

- Do not keep tests that only lock in outdated behavior.
- Replace stale tests with stronger coverage where that provides better signal.

---

## 9. Backend Review Checklist

Before finishing backend API work, verify:

1. Does every changed route have real request/response schemas?
2. Do handlers return mapped DTOs instead of raw Prisma rows?
3. Is `operationId` present and unique?
4. Does `npm run api:refresh` succeed?
5. Does `npm run api:validate` succeed?
6. Did generated files update as expected?
7. Do SDK functional tests cover the changed endpoints?

---

## 10. Pre-Commit Self-Review

Before committing backend code, scan changed files for anti-patterns:

| Pattern to find | What it means | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `additionalProperties: true` in route schemas | Passthrough/generic response schema | Replace with Zod DTO |
| Placeholder schema on a route returning domain data | Not a real contract | Create domain-specific response DTO |
| `{ type: 'object', properties:` in route files | Inline JSON schema instead of Zod | Move to shared `dto/` package |
| `prisma.*.find` in handler or route files | Raw Prisma access outside service layer | Move to service; return through mapper |
| `.map((` in route or handler files | Inline transformation | Extract to mapper file |

If any of these patterns appear in changed files, fix them before committing.
