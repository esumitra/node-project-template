# Architecture Rules

All plan documents and implementation work must conform to these rules. This is the single source of truth for system-level architecture, infrastructure, and cross-cutting decisions.

**For implementation-level rules, see:**
- **[Service Rules](service-rules.md)** — backend TypeScript, Fastify, Prisma, OpenAPI, DTO, and mapper rules
- **[React UI Rules](react-ui-rules.md)** — React app technology, generated API client usage, TanStack Query, and frontend testing patterns
- **[UX Rules](ux-rules.md)** — first-draft UX conventions, action hierarchy, state communication, accessibility
- **[Testing Rules](testing-rules.md)** — unit, integration, functional API, smoke, and browser E2E rules
- **[Workflow Rules](workflow-rules.md)** — spec-driven lifecycle, plan tracking, and rule maintenance
- **[Domain Model Conventions Rules](domain-model-conventions-rules.md)** — lifecycle naming, `status` vs `isActive`, and shared domain-model consistency defaults

## 2. Contract-First API Architecture

The project is **contract-first at the API boundary**.

The source-of-truth chain is:

`Zod DTO schema → Fastify route schema → exported OpenAPI spec → generated hey-api client → web app usage`

Required implications:

- Backend routes must describe real request and response payloads.
- OpenAPI generation is part of the build contract, not optional documentation.
- Frontend code must consume the generated SDK/types instead of recreating API contracts locally.
- If the generated client is wrong, fix the backend route schema or DTO first. Do not patch around it in app code.

### OpenAPI Rules

- The live Fastify app is the source for exported OpenAPI, not a hand-written YAML file.
- `npm run api:refresh` is the standard regeneration command (export spec + regenerate client).
- `npm run api:validate` must stay green.
- Generated files are artifacts. Do not hand-edit them.

### Route Source of Truth

- A shared `api-routes.ts` file is the source of truth for canonical route constants used by backend, integration tests, smoke tests, and MSW handlers.
- For frontend runtime code, the generated SDK is the primary path source of truth.

---

## 3. No Mock Data in Application Code

This is a non-negotiable architecture rule.

- Application code must never ship mock data, fake data, seeded sample responses, or development-only fallback payloads.
- If an endpoint is missing or broken, surface loading/error/empty UI states. Do not hide the defect with fake data.
- This applies across backend services, web hooks/pages/stores, and shared runtime modules.
- Test doubles belong only in test code, fixtures, previews, or dedicated test infrastructure.

Banned patterns:

- `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') return mockData`
- `initialData: mockData` in TanStack Query
- `queryFn: async () => mockData`
- `catch { return mockData }`
- Hand-built success envelopes that do not reflect the real domain payload

---

## 4. Service Topology

All backend services are TypeScript services with explicit module boundaries.

| Service | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Core API | Auth, domain CRUD, admin, notifications, history |
| Domain modules | Specialized business logic (e.g., draft engines, scoring) |
| Ingestion worker | External data provider ingestion |
| Notification module | In-app delivery orchestration |

### Architectural Rules

- Keep domain modules isolated behind services and mappers.
- Route handlers do not return raw Prisma models.
- Database access stays behind service/repository boundaries.
- Cross-module communication uses shared events and typed contracts.
- Multi-tenancy or domain isolation must remain explicit in request context and persistence boundaries.

### Domain Event Bus

The in-process event bus is the primary mechanism for cross-module communication. It is an architectural seam, not an implementation detail.

- Every domain event type must be defined as a typed interface in a shared events package.
- Services emit events after successful state changes, not before.
- Subscribers must not assume emission order or delivery guarantees beyond "at least once, in process."
- Event payloads must be serializable (no Prisma models, no class instances, no functions).
- When adding a new event type, update the event type registry and add emission + subscriber tests.

### Structural Rules

- Tests remain outside production `src/` folders.
- Generated API artifacts live under the shared package's `generated/` directory.
- The web app consumes the generated API package.
- Do not create parallel handwritten clients when the shared generated client exists.

## 6. App Identity and Access

Before building authenticated features, define and document:

1. **User identity model** — how users are identified, what attributes they carry, whether they are global or scoped.
2. **Roles and permissions** — what roles exist, how they are assigned, what each role can do.
3. **Authentication mechanism** — JWT, cookies/sessions, social auth, MFA requirements.
4. **Authorization boundaries** — what entity (organization, workspace, team) scopes a user's permissions.
5. **Admin vs. product separation** — whether platform administration is a separate surface or role-based within the product.

These decisions should be captured in a use-case document before implementation. The auth module and permission system are foundational — retrofitting them is expensive.

### Recommended Defaults

- One web application with role-based access (not separate admin/user apps).
- JWT access tokens (short-lived) + refresh tokens (DB-stored, revocable).
- Permissions stored per-membership within the scoping entity.
- Admin capability as an elevated role, not a separate identity system, unless platform operations genuinely require separation.

## 7. Documentation and Drift Prevention

Architecture rules must describe the codebase that actually exists, not an aspirational future state.

- When API-contract flow changes, update these architecture rules and the service/react/testing rules in the same change.
- When testing patterns change materially, update testing rules.
- When generated-client usage changes, update react UI rules, service rules, and model change rules.
- If a rule conflicts with the codebase after a refactor, update the rule immediately.
