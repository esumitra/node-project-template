# Workflow Rules

## 1. Spec-Driven Development Lifecycle

All product work follows a spec-driven lifecycle. Agents must not skip phases or implement behavior that hasn't been specified.

### Phase 1: Requirements and Domain Modeling

Before any design or implementation:

1. **Define requirements** — what the product does, who it serves, what problems it solves.
2. **Define the domain model** — identify domain objects, their relationships, lifecycle states, and ownership boundaries.
3. **Define modules** — group related domain objects into service modules with clear boundaries.

Deliverables: requirements document, domain model diagram or description, module map.

### Phase 2: Use Cases

For each module or feature area:

1. **Write use-case companions** — document concrete user journeys: who does what, in what order, what they see, what can go wrong.
2. **Identify roles and permissions** — which actors can perform which actions.
3. **Identify business rules** — validation, uniqueness, lifecycle constraints, authorization boundaries.
4. **Identify deferred scope** — explicitly state what is out of scope for the current phase.

Deliverables: use-case companion documents per module, stored in `plans/`.

**Rule: Agents must not implement behavior that isn't covered by a documented use case. If a use case is missing, write it first.**

### Phase 3: Design Plans

Informed by requirements and use cases:

1. **Make architectural decisions** — what to build, what to remove, what to defer, how modules interact.
2. **Define data model changes** — schema, migrations, new/removed entities.
3. **Define API surface** — endpoints, request/response shapes, authorization rules.
4. **Identify dependencies** — which plans must complete before others can start.

Deliverables: design plan documents in `plans/`, with clear decisions and rationale.

### Phase 4: Execution Plans

Break design plans into implementable work:

1. **Slice work into independent units** — each slice should be committable and validatable on its own.
2. **Track at layer granularity** — schema, service, DTOs, mappers, route schemas, tests are separate trackable items within a slice.
3. **Define deliverables per slice** — concrete files and artifacts, not vague descriptions.
4. **Define dependencies** — which slices must complete before others can start.

Deliverables: execution plan with task table in `plans/`.

### Phase 5: Implementation

Execute slices against plans with quality gates. See sections below for tracking and validation rules.

---

## 2. Plan Tracking

Every plan document in `plans/` has an **Action Plan** section with a task table.

### Task Table Format

```markdown
| ID | Phase | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01-001 | 1 | Task description | Done | Completed notes |
| 01-002 | 1 | Task description | In Progress | What's done, what remains |
| 01-003 | 1 | Task description | Not Started | |
```

### Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Not Started | Work has not begun |
| In Progress | Work has started but is not complete |
| Done | Fully implemented, tested, and validated |
| Removed | Out of scope; explain why |

### Required Workflow

When starting work:

1. Find the relevant task in the plan.
2. Mark it `In Progress`.
3. Add notes about the implementation slice you are taking.

When finishing work:

1. Mark the task `Done` or `Removed`.
2. Add notes with the relevant files and decisions.
3. Update every affected plan, not just the first one you looked at.

---

## 3. Slice Execution Rules

- Keep one execution slice per commit unless explicitly approved to bundle.
- Report every changed file in the final handoff for a slice.
- If slice work exposes adjacent-slice files or tasks, stop and report that spillover instead of bundling it.
- Update plan rows only for the exact slice being worked. Do not mark unrelated items `Done`.
- Mark a slice `Done` only when all applicable layers are complete and validated. Partial work stays `In Progress`.
- If code cleanup resolves a previously logged plan finding, reconcile that plan finding in the same or immediately following slice. Do not leave active plans implying drift that no longer exists in the codebase.

### Slice Completion Checklist (Required Before Marking Done)

Before marking any backend slice task `Done`, verify each applicable item:

**Schema & Domain:**
- [ ] Prisma schema updated (if model changed)
- [ ] Migration generated (if schema changed)
- [ ] Shared domain types/enums updated

**DTOs & Mappers:**
- [ ] Zod request DTO exists for every request body
- [ ] Zod response DTO exists for every response
- [ ] Mapper file exists with named export functions
- [ ] Handlers call mapper functions — no inline transformations

**Route Schemas:**
- [ ] Every route uses `zodToJsonSchema()` — no inline JSON objects
- [ ] No route uses placeholder schemas for endpoints returning domain data
- [ ] Every route has `operationId`, `summary`, and `tags`
- [ ] Changed backend/shared contract work also satisfies the contract-documentation checklist from `rules/service-rules.md`

**Tests:**
- [ ] Unit test exists for service logic
- [ ] DB integration test covers CRUD for new/changed domain objects
- [ ] SDK functional test covers use-case journeys and error paths
- [ ] Coverage on changed files meets threshold

**OpenAPI:**
- [ ] `npm run api:refresh` succeeds
- [ ] `npm run api:validate` succeeds

A slice that lands the schema and service logic but skips DTOs, mappers, or tests is `In Progress`, not `Done`.

For backend/shared contract slices, "complete" also means the documentation surface is complete enough for frontend consumption:

- Route descriptions are updated where behavior is not obvious.
- DTO/object descriptions exist for changed payloads.
- Field semantics are described where names alone are not enough.
- Any backend explanation that frontend needed has been pushed back into the contract source instead of left as one-off tribal knowledge.

### Slice Deliverables

When plans break work into slices, track at layer granularity:

```markdown
| D.1 | Schema + migration | Done |
| D.2 | Service + repository | Done |
| D.3 | DTOs (request + response Zod schemas) | Not Started |
| D.4 | Mappers | Not Started |
| D.5 | Route schemas (zodToJsonSchema, operationId, tags) | Not Started |
| D.6 | Unit tests | In Progress |
| D.7 | Integration tests (CRUD + negative paths) | Not Started |
| D.8 | Functional API tests | Not Started |
```

## 4. Rule and Documentation Maintenance

Rules are part of the codebase contract.

When a refactor changes architecture, API usage, testing patterns, or generated-client workflow:

- Update the relevant file in `rules/` in the same change.
- Do not leave stale rules behind for a future cleanup.
- Tighten rules after a painful refactor so the same mistake is harder to repeat.

---

## 5. Required Local Validation Before Push

Before pushing code, agents must run the full local quality gate set unless explicitly approved to skip.

Required local pre-push commands:

1. `npm run typecheck`
2. `npm run lint`
3. `npm run test:service:unit`
4. `npm run test:service:integration`
5. `npm run test:service:functional-api`
6. `npm run test:coverage:service:merged`
7. `npm run test:<projectName>:unit`
8. `npm run openapi-contract-check` when API schemas change

Rules:

- Treat these as pre-push gates, not optional follow-up checks.
- Do not rely on CI to discover failures that could have been caught locally.
- Do not push backend changes on a "likely green" assumption. The local gate must actually pass first.
- Do not intentionally skip required backend gates and defer that validation to CI.
- Coverage threshold enforcement is part of the required gate.
- If a gate is blocked by local environment constraints, state that clearly before pushing.
- For backend/service changes, the default is simple: no push until lint, typecheck, unit, data integration, FAPI, and merged service coverage have passed locally. If API contracts changed, `openapi-contract-check` must also pass first.
- If a DB-backed backend gate fails only because the sandbox cannot reach the local database, rerun that exact command outside the sandbox before pushing. Do not treat the sandbox failure as permission to skip the gate.

---

## 6. Do Not Preserve Bad Patterns

- Remove or replace stale tests that enforce retired code paths.
- Remove dead endpoints and unused UI instead of keeping them "for later."
- Strengthen rules when a refactor reveals a repeated failure mode.

---

## 7. Use-Case Design Must Surface Backend Implications

When designing new webapp features or product flows, the design review must explicitly surface any implied backend or model changes required by the proposed behavior, including:

- Prisma/model changes
- Migrations or backfills
- New DTOs or API routes
- Backend auth/session or invitation-flow changes

Confirm those backend implications with the project owner before implementation begins.

When those implications suggest a true model change, route them through the data-modeler and have the review explicitly check [domain-model-conventions-rules.md](domain-model-conventions-rules.md) before backend implementation begins.

Do not assume that an early scaffold or placeholder page defines the final product flow. Plans should be use-case driven and confirmed with the project owner before implementation expands.

For browser-E2E planning, prefer real user/role lifecycle flows over root-admin or test-only shortcuts. If cleanup or setup appears to need privileged APIs, first ask whether the real product lifecycle should own that behavior instead.

---

## 8. Persona Playbooks

- Persona playbooks may live under `agents/` to scope role-specific workflows such as product management, project management, data modeling, backend implementation, frontend implementation, architecture/platform work, and code review.
- These playbooks are execution aids, not replacement policy sources.
- `AGENTS.md` and `rules/` remain canonical.
- Formal persona names remain the canonical workflow language in plans, rules, and handoffs. Nicknames are optional shorthand for prompts, logs, worker updates, and conversational references.
- When a nickname is used, it must map to exactly one formal persona and must not replace the formal responsibility definition.
- If a new persona is added later, assign a unique nickname in the persona file and add it to the table below rather than inventing ad hoc shorthand in worker prompts.

Current persona nickname map:

| Formal Persona | Nickname | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Application Specification Builder | Abe | Technology-neutral rebuild specifications and handoff docs |
| Data Modeler | Dom | Model and contract impact classification |
| Backend Developer | Brad | Service, DTO, OpenAPI, and test implementation |
| Frontend Developer | Fran | Web UI and browser-flow delivery |
| Product Manager | Pam | Product/use-case clarification and review |
| Project Manager | Parker | Plan shaping, sequencing, and reconciliation |
| Architect | Archie | Cross-cutting architecture and platform work |
| Code Reviewer | Riley | Findings-first review and risk detection |

- Cross-cutting workflow requirements remain mandatory for all personas, including:
  - Checking for active plans
  - Updating task rows for the exact slice worked
  - Validating work before marking slices done
  - Updating docs and rules when the change affects them
- The `project-manager` persona may help with plan shaping, sequencing, and progress reconciliation, but it is not the sole owner of task tracking. Agents doing implementation work must still update plans themselves.

### Frontend / Data Model / Backend Handoff Rules

- Frontend implementation should normally work from:
  - reviewed plans and use-case companions
  - generated SDK operations
  - generated request/response types
  - documented OpenAPI summaries/descriptions
- Frontend agents must not answer contract ambiguity by treating backend implementation code as the working spec.
- If frontend work reveals a possible shared-contract, DTO, or model change, stop and route that question through the `data-modeler` persona first unless the change is already explicitly reviewed and obviously backend-owned.
- The `data-modeler` persona classifies whether the request is:
  - UI-only
  - contract-only
  - a real model/domain/persistence change
- The data-modeler review must happen before backend implementation begins on any feature where model, DTO, contract, or persistence impact is plausible. Do not skip directly from frontend/product discovery to backend coding when that classification step is still unresolved.
- If the change is not obvious and clear from the reviewed plan, confirm the backend/model implication with the user before implementation continues.
- Backend/shared changes discovered during frontend work must be implemented by the backend developer persona, not by the frontend developer persona.
- If the frontend developer has a contract question, ask the backend developer persona for the answer instead of reading backend code directly.
- When such a question reveals a contract documentation gap, the backend developer must fix that documentation gap as part of the handoff, not merely answer the question once.
- Backend slices that change API contracts must include that documentation-gap repair in the same slice rather than leaving it as follow-up cleanup.
- When a feature needs backend/shared contract changes, the frontend persona must wait until the backend persona has completed the contract work, run the required backend validation gates, and regenerated/exported the SDK and types before starting frontend implementation against that new contract. Do not begin frontend implementation against an intended contract change before the updated exported SDK/types actually exist.
- Product work must perform a current-truth review — active plans, current domain model, current DTO/OpenAPI contract, and currently implemented routes and role behavior — before proposing fields or flow steps. Archived UI, superseded plans, or broad DTO surface area are not evidence that a field belongs in the current product flow.
- Product ambiguity belongs with the user. Contract ambiguity belongs with the backend developer. Model-impact classification belongs with the data-modeler.

---

## 9. Plan Closeout and Archiving

- Plans are execution tools, not long-lived policy documents. Durable rules belong in `rules/`, not in active plans.
- When all tasks in a plan are done or removed, archive it under `plans/archive/`.
- Update any active plans that reference the archived plan.
- If a plan contained temporary guidance that has become durable policy, move it into `rules/` during closeout.
