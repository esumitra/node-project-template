# Testing Rules

All services and clients must follow these testing standards. This document defines the testing strategy, quality gates, and when old tests should be removed rather than preserved.

## 1. Testing Tools

### Backend

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Jest | Unit and integration test runner |
| Fastify `inject` | Request/response integration testing |
| Prisma test DB / local Postgres | Persistence-backed integration tests |
| Generated hey-api SDK | Functional API tests (full-stack through SDK) |
| `nock` / service mocks | External dependency isolation |

### Frontend

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Vitest | Unit and integration test runner |
| React Testing Library | User-focused component and page tests |
| MSW | Request-level API mocking |
| Playwright | Browser E2E tests |

---

## 2. Test Layers

### Backend

| Layer | Scope | Real DB | Interface | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | Function/service behavior | No | Direct function calls | Mock dependencies intentionally |
| Integration | Fastify + services + persistence | Yes | `app.inject()` | Validates persistence and routing |
| Functional API | Full stack through generated SDK | Yes | hey-api SDK over HTTP | Primary behavioral test surface |
| Smoke | Deployed environment health | Deployed | Raw HTTP | Thin post-deploy verification |

### Frontend

| Layer | Scope | API |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | Presentational components, utilities | Mocked only if network irrelevant |
| Integration | Hooks/pages/user flows | MSW |
| Browser E2E | Deployed browser flows | Real deployed API |

### What Each Layer Proves

- **Unit tests** prove service logic works with controlled inputs.
- **Integration tests** prove persistence and query behavior against a real database.
- **Functional API tests** prove the entire stack works end-to-end: SDK types → HTTP → routing → validation → service → database → response → SDK deserialization. This is the **primary behavioral test surface**.
- **Smoke tests** prove a deployed environment is healthy (not behavioral coverage).
- **Browser E2E** proves the UI works as a user would experience it.

## 3. Required Local Quality Gates

Before pushing code:

1. `npm run typecheck`
2. `npm run lint`
3. `npm run test:service:unit` (service unit tests)
4. `npm run test:service:integration` (service DB integration tests)
5. `npm run test:service:functional-api` (service SDK functional API tests)
6. `npm run test:coverage:service:merged` (merged service coverage)
7. `npm run test:<projectName>:unit` (frontend unit tests)
8. `npm run openapi-contract-check` when API schemas change

Notes:
- Treat these as pre-push gates, not optional follow-up checks.
- Coverage threshold enforcement is part of the required gate.
- Smoke tests and browser E2E remain CI/deployment signals.

---

## 4. Functional API Test Suite

The functional API test suite is the **primary pre-merge behavioral test surface**. It exercises the entire service stack through the generated SDK client.

### Architecture

```
Test Runner (Jest)
  └── hey-api SDK (typed operations)
        └── HTTP (localhost:0, random port)
              └── Fastify (listen, real routing, validation, auth)
                    └── Service → Repository → Prisma → Postgres
                          └── Response → Fastify serialization → SDK deserialization
```

Tests start Fastify with `app.listen({ port: 0 })` and configure the SDK client to target `http://localhost:{port}`. This exercises the full request/response cycle including HTTP serialization, the SDK's type system, and real database persistence.

### What It Tests

1. **CRUD operations** — create, read, update, delete for every domain object.
2. **Use-case workflows** — multi-step journeys matching documented use cases.
3. **Business rules** — validation, uniqueness, lifecycle constraints, ownership.
4. **Authorization** — unauthenticated, wrong-role, wrong-scope rejection.
5. **Error behavior** — structured error responses for 400, 401, 403, 404, 409.
6. **Data integrity** — query results after operations, verify database state matches expectations.

### File Naming

Files use `.functional.ts` suffix: `league-lifecycle.functional.ts`, `auth.functional.ts`, etc.

### Use-Case Traceability

Every functional test must trace to a documented use case. Reference the plan and use-case ID in a comment or describe block name.

### Data Strategy

- Functional tests create all data through SDK operations (not Prisma inserts).
- Use shared builder functions for repeated object-graph setup.
- Builders use SDK operations so they are themselves testing the create path.
- Use unique identifiers (timestamps, UUIDs) to avoid collisions.
- Functional cleanup helpers must delete child records before parent records; for multi-entity flows, remove dependent entities before the owning entities.
- Functional builders and setup helpers must fail descriptively. When an SDK setup call fails, include the response status and error payload in the thrown error so review and debugging do not stop at a vague "register failed" message.

### Assertion Rules

- Assertions must be strong and intentional. Do not accept broad fallback status ranges like `200 | 400 | 500`.
- When endpoint contracts change, functional tests must change with them.
- When a slice introduces or standardizes intentional error conditions, functional API coverage must include explicit negative-path cases for those errors and assert the expected application error codes, not just the HTTP status.
- Do not stop at a single generic failure case when the route exposes multiple meaningful denial reasons; cover the distinct error conditions that the frontend or other clients need to handle differently.

### Contract Subsumption

If the SDK compiles and the typed response is correct, the contract is proven. Separate `.safeParse()` contract tests are not needed when functional API tests cover the endpoints.

---

## 5. Contract Testing Rules

For endpoints not yet covered by the functional API suite, contract tests must validate live responses against DTO Zod schemas using `.safeParse()`.

A backend slice that adds or changes an API endpoint is **not complete** until either:
- A functional API test covers the endpoint, or
- A contract test validates the response shape.

Do not defer contract or functional test coverage to a later cleanup slice.

---

## 6. Test Data Builders

Tests must create complex object graphs through shared builder functions, not copy-pasted setup blocks.

### Rules

- Shared test builders live in `tests/helpers/builders.ts` or `tests/functional/builders.ts`.
- Each builder creates a valid domain object through real service calls or SDK operations.
- Builders return the created object (with ID) so tests can reference it.
- Builders accept optional overrides; use sensible defaults for everything else.
- Builders must use unique identifiers to avoid collisions.

---

## 7. Domain Event Testing

The in-process event bus is a critical architectural seam.

### What Must Be Tested

- **Event emission**: Verify the correct event is emitted with the expected payload after a state change.
- **Subscriber behavior**: Verify the subscriber performs the expected side effect when an event is received.
- **Event contract**: Event payloads must match typed interfaces.

### Rules

- Every domain event type must have at least one emission test and one subscriber test.
- When adding a new event type, add both tests in the same slice.
- Test observable behavior, not event bus internals.

---

## 8. Integration Test Depth Requirement

Integration test files must not be single-case stubs. Each file should include at minimum:

- **Happy path**: The primary use case succeeds.
- **Validation/negative path**: Invalid input rejected with correct status code and error shape.
- **Permission/authorization path**: Returns 401 or 403 for unauthorized callers.
- **Not-found path**: Returns 404 for non-existent resources.

Aim for 3-5 test cases per domain integration file.

---

## 9. Integration Test Isolation and Cleanup

Integration tests share a single Postgres database and run serially.

- Every test that creates data must clean up in `afterAll` or `afterEach`.
- Tests must not depend on data created by other test files.
- Tests must not depend on execution order.
- Use unique identifiers for all created records.
- Do not rely on `prisma migrate reset` between test runs.

---

## 10. Smoke and Browser E2E Rules

### Use-Case Traceability

Every smoke and E2E test must trace to a documented use case. Reference the plan and use-case ID.

### API Smoke Tests

- Lives under `tests/api/functional/*.smoke.ts`.
- Thin post-deploy health and connectivity verification.
- Smoke tests create their own data through real deployed API routes.
- Do not rely on seed data, fake UUIDs, or preexisting state.
- Assertions must be strong and intentional.
- Keep scope minimal: health check, auth round-trip, one core domain operation.

### Browser E2E Tests (Playwright)

- Lives under `clients/<projectName>/e2e/`.
- Uses Playwright against a running app.
- In CI, browser E2E runs only after smoke tests succeed.

**Use-case driven:**
- E2E tests prove complete user journeys, not page loads.
- Tests perform the full action: fill forms, click buttons, verify state changes.
- Assert observable outcomes, not just "page rendered."

**Data strategy:**
- Create data through real UI flows whenever possible.
- Do not hardcode seed data IDs.
- Seeded admin credentials are acceptable for admin flows.

**Selector rules:**
- Prefer stable machine selectors (`data-testid`, stable `id`) over visible text.
- Do not anchor tests to marketing copy or translated strings unless testing that copy.

**Error detection:**
- Every E2E test must assert no uncaught exceptions, no console errors, and no error boundary fallback UI.

---

## 11. What Must Be Tested

### Backend

- Authentication and authorization behavior
- Route validation behavior
- DTO contract compliance
- Error response shape compliance
- Persistence for changed model fields
- Domain isolation boundaries
- Domain event emission and subscriber behavior
- Critical business flows as documented in use cases

### Frontend

- Loading, error, and empty states
- Form validation and submission
- Navigation to critical product pages
- Mutations that change server state
- Critical authenticated flows

---

## 12. What Not To Do

- Do not keep tests that verify bad architecture.
- Do not preserve tests for removed UI or endpoints.
- Do not update mocks without checking whether the real contract changed.
- Do not hand-wave broken contract tests.
- Do not skip OpenAPI validation after changing route schemas.

---

## 13. Documentation Drift Rules

If test strategy changes materially, update this file in the same work.
