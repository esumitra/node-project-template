# Application Specifications

The `specs/` directory holds technology-neutral application specifications that describe how the application can be recreated or re-implemented from scratch.

These files are intended to support:

- Planning agents
- Backend and frontend implementation agents
- Product and model review
- Future rebuild or migration work

They are not meant to duplicate the current codebase line by line.

## Directory Structure

```

## File Intent

- `shared/glossary.md` — canonical terminology and important term mappings.
- `shared/roles-and-actors.md` — role definitions and major capability boundaries.
- `shared/navigation-and-entry-points.md` — top-level routes, entry points, and global navigation concepts.
- `domains/<domain-slug>/overview.md` — feature/domain purpose and scope.
- `domains/<domain-slug>/use-cases.md` — role-oriented use cases and functional expectations.
- `domains/<domain-slug>/domain-model.md` — domain nouns, relationships, lifecycle behavior, and invariants.
- `domains/<domain-slug>/api-surface.md` — route inventory with request/response type references.
- `domains/<domain-slug>/screens.md` — page purposes, actions, and page-to-API relationships.
- `domains/<domain-slug>/flows.md` — end-to-end flow descriptions and state transitions.
- `domains/<domain-slug>/open-questions.md` — unresolved items, confirmed drift, and deferred work.

## How Implementation Agents Should Use These Specs

Implementation agents should treat these files as rebuild requirements and use them to:

- Create or update execution plans
- Confirm product intent before coding
- Identify model or contract implications
- Map screens to API usage without reverse-engineering every route from scratch

When a spec and implementation disagree:

- Check the active plans
- Check the exported contracts
- Document the mismatch explicitly before assuming either side is correct
